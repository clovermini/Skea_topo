## Abstract
Topological consistency plays a crucial role in the task of boundary segmentation for reticular images, such as cell membrane segmentation in neuron electron microscopic images, grain boundary segmentation in material microscopic images and road segmentation in aerial images. In these fields, topological changes in segmentation results have a serious impact on the downstream tasks, which can even exceed the misalignment of the boundary itself. To enhance the topology accuracy in segmentation results, we propose the Skea-Topo Aware loss, which is a novel loss function that takes into account the shape of each object and topological significance of the pixels. It consists of two components. First, the skeleton-aware weighted loss improves the segmentation accuracy by better modeling the object geometry with skeletons. Second, a boundary rectified term effectively identifies and emphasizes topological critical pixels in the prediction errors using both foreground and background skeletons in the ground truth and predictions. Experiments prove that our method improves topological consistency by up to 7 points in VI compared to 13 state-of-art methods, based on objective and subjective assessments across three different boundary segmentation datasets.

## Environment

    python 3.8
    pytorch 1.13.0+cu116
    gala (for evaluation)

gala is installed according to https://github.com/janelia-flyem/gala.

## Prepare datasets and running
- SNEMI3D can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/7142003, and it should be placed in ./data/snemi3d/.  <br>
- IRON can be downloaded from https://github.com/Keep-Passion/pure_iron_grain_data_sets, and it should be placed in ./data/iron/.  <br>
- MASS ROAD can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/massachusetts-roads-dataset, and it should be placed in ./data/mass_road/.  <br>

Usage Demo:

    # prepare datasets and calculate mean and std for each datasets
    python ./data/data_generator.py
    
    # generate skeleton aware weighted map:
    python ./data/skeleton_aware_loss_gen.py

    # skeleton aware weighted map for DRIVE:
    python ./data/skeleton_aware_loss_gen_single_object.py

    # generate foreground and background skeletons for labels
    python ./data/skeleton_gen.py

    # train
    run train.ipynb

    # eval 
    run eval.ipynb
